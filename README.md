# Ludum Dare Weekend Warmup (2015)
In preparation of [Ludum Dare 33](http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/04/15/welcome-to-ludum-dare-32/), I 
had a "Weekend Warmup" where I built a game from scratch over a single weekend. Using [Unity](http://unity3d.com/), 
I built **Burroughs Goes to Work,** a game where the player faces the mean streets of the city in an attempt to get our 
protagonist to work each day.

Because each day his trek to work gets longer, he spends the evenings benching in an attempt to "[get huge](http://i.imgur.com/TfbIeUl.jpg)."

You can play in your web browser at [http://adampassey.github.io/ludum-dare-warmup/web_build](http://adampassey.github.io/ludum-dare-warmup/web_build). If
you prefer to download the build locally, [click here](https://github.com/adampassey/ludum-dare-warmup/archive/master.zip) and open `build` once the download is complete.

_The Unity web player sometimes has a difficult time detecting mouse clicks, which will make gaining stamina very difficult._
_You have been warned!_

**Cheers!**
